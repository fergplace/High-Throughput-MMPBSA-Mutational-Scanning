    "# Methods: Binding Free Energy Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Binding Free Energy Decomposition\n",
    "The Binding Free Energy (BFE) of a complex is determined by the change in enthalpy ($\\Delta H$) and entropy ($\\Delta S$) at a given temperature ($T$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$$\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](_more_figs/MMPBSA_dia_smoll.drawio.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a computational framework, $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$ is estimated using a thermodynamic cycle that relates the vacuum binding energy to the solvation free energies of the complex, receptor, and ligand:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta G_{\\text{bind, solv}}^{\\circ} = \\Delta G_{\\text{bind, vacuum}}^{\\circ} + \\Delta G_{\\text{complex}}^{\\circ} - (\\Delta G_{\\text{ligand}}^{\\circ} + \\Delta G_{\\text{receptor}}^{\\circ})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](_more_figs/Figures/MMPBSA_dia_clean.drawio.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The solvation term ($\\Delta G_{\\text{solv}}^{\\circ}$) is split into polar and non-polar components, while the vacuum term accounts for molecular mechanics energy ($\\Delta E_{\\text{MM}}$) and configurational entropy ($(T\\Delta S)^*$):\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\Delta G_{\\text{solv}}^{\\circ} = \\Delta G_{\\text{polar}}^{\\circ} + \\Delta G_{\\text{non-polar}}^{\\circ}$\n",
    "- $\\Delta G_{\\text{vacuum}}^{\\circ} = \\Delta E_{\\text{MM}} - (T\\Delta S)^*$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. MM/PB(GB)SA Framework\n",
    "The MM/PB(GB)SA approach is an all-atom end-point method. It calculates the average BFE over a set of uncorrelated snapshots extracted from a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation trajectory. \n",
    "\n",
    "This study utilizes a **single-trajectory protocol**, where the average BFE is determined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = \\langle G_{\\text{complex, i}} - G_{\\text{protein, i}} - G_{\\text{ligand, i}} \\rangle_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](_more_figs/Figures/MMPBSA_dia_snapsdrawio.png.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solvation Free Energy Components\n",
    "- **Polar Component:** Calculated using either the **Poisson-Boltzmann (PB)** method (a grid-based numerical solution) or the **Generalized Born (GB)** model (an analytical approximation). While PB is often more accurate, GB models (like GB5 and GBNSR6/GB66) are preferred for large systems due to computational efficiency.\n",
    "- **Non-Polar Component:** Estimated based on the Solvent-Accessible Surface Area (SASA): $\\Delta G_{\\text{nonpolar}} = \\gamma * SASA$.\n",
    "- **Entropy:** Omitted in this study. Localized single-residue mutations typically result in minimal entropic changes compared to the significant enthalpic contributions observed in Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Gas-Phase Energy and Atomic Radii\n",
    "- **Force Field:** Calculations use **ff19SB** in AMBER23, optimized for the **OPC** water model.\n",
    "- **Atomic Radii:** Implicit solvent predictions are highly sensitive to the Dielectric Boundary. We evaluate three sets: **Mbondi2**, **OPT1** (optimized for polar $\\Delta \\Delta G$), and **OPT5D** (optimized for both solvation and binding errors)."
