    "# HTMS_Amber: Alanine & Non-Alanine Scanning Pipeline\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This package aims to improve upon the base Alanine scanning method within [Amber](https://ambermd.org/) by offering a rapid and easily accessible computational tool for calculating changes in Binding Free Energy ($\\Delta\\Delta G_{bind}$) for in silico mutations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on running simulations, see the Usage Section below.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Prerequisites\n",
    "You will need:\n",
    "- **Conda** or **Mamba**: If you do not have it, see [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).\n",
    "- [**AMBER**](https://ambermd.org/): Required for Alanine Scanning and MMPBSA calculations.\n",
    "- [**MODELLER**](https://salilab.org/modeller/): Required for multiple point mutations and specific single point mutations (see [Mutation Details](#-non-alanine-mutations)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Clone the Repository\n",
    "Download the project to your local machine using one of the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Via GitHub Desktop:**\n",
    "1. Click the green **Code** button at the top of this page.\n",
    "2. Select **Open with GitHub Desktop**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Via Command Line:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HTMS_Amber.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HTMS_Amber.git)\n",
    "cd HTMS_Amber\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Create and activate the conda env\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "conda env create -f htms_conda_env.yml\n",
    "conda activate amber_muts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on **MODELLER** installation\n",
    "To make full use of the pipline a reistered MODELLER install is required see https://salilab.org/modeller/registration.html \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resource Optimization\n",
    "1. Use GPU resources for the production MD runs.\n",
    "2. Scale back to minimal CPU and memory for the MMPBSA.py analysis portion.\n",
    "\n",
